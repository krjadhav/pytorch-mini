            Let's say we have an expression o = a + b
            We want to find the derivative of o with respect to a (do/da)
            Using the definition of the derivative: d/dx f(x) as lim h->0 = (f(x+h) - f(x)) / h 
            
            do/da = (((a + h) + b) - (a + b)) / h
            => (a + h + b - a - b) / h
            => h / h => 1

            Similarly, do/db = ((a + (b + h)) - (a + b)) / h
            => (a + b + h - a - b) / h
            => h / h => 1

            

            Suppose L is the loss and o is one of it's intermediate nodes in the computation graph.
            We can find the gradient of L with respect to a and b, using the chain rule.
            dL/da = (dL/do) * (do/da)
            dL/db = (dL/do) * (do/db)

            We know from calculating the local derivatives that,
            do/da = 1
            do/db = 1

            dL/da = (dL/do) * 1
            dL/db = (dL/do) * 1

            The forward pass, calculates outputs o and the backward pass calculates gradients.

            When we trace back the computation graph, each node's .grad stores the computed gradient of the loss with respect to the node's value.
            In this case, out.grad stores the computed gradient of the loss L with respect to the output of the function o.
            Substituting, dL/do = out.grad

            self.grad += out.grad
            other.grad += out.grad

            Why += instead of = ?
            Anytime we have a node that is used multiple times in the computation graph, we need to accumulate the gradients.
            If we use = instead of +=, it will override the gradient of the previous computation.

            Let's say o = a + a
            Then do/da = ((a + h) + (a + h)) - (a + a) /h
            => (2a + 2h - 2a)/h => 2

            o.grad = 1
            a.grad = o.grad * 1 = 1
            a.grad = o.grad * 1 = 1

            Then a.grad = 1 which is wrong

            However, if we use += instead of =,
            a.grad = 0
            a.grad += o.grad * 1 = 1
            a.grad += o.grad * 1 = 2

            a.grad = 2 which is correct
